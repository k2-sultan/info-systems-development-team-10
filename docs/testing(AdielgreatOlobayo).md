# Testing

## Test Plan

### Test case 1 : testing to see if user can sign in or search any other data type in Bristol Open Data in Map.html

#### Results:
  Once user tries to use the search function to access any other database, user will be given the option to select other data bases if the searched database is found.

#### Issue:
  Both my Partner and I wish to run it locally on the software by using the ArcGIS () so that users will have less distractions while inspecting the map. However, we encountered an issue     whe we could not insert a search button ourselves i.e user could only interact with the map but could not search for specific informaion.

#### Current Status: Fail

| Use-Case ID | Requirement ID | Test Case | Status |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |

TODO: Add rows for each test, current status is eg. pass/fail
