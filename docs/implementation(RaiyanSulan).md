# Implementation (Done by Raiyan Sultan)

## Introduction
The dataset utilized for this project is the Air Quality Dashboard Map from Bristol Open Data, (https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/maps/a26113cd0bef4ef0816242a08ae0b1a6/explore). It provides annual NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide) concentration levels for selected areas within Bristol. Additionally, it includes historical NO₂ data, allowing users to analyze past air quality trends in these regions.

One of the key features of this dataset is its interactive search functionality, which enables users to locate and view NO₂ concentration data for specific locations marked on the map. However, a known limitation is that it does not provide air quality information for unmarked areas, meaning that some locations may not have recorded data available.

As of the most recent update, the dataset was last recorded on December 13, 2024.
