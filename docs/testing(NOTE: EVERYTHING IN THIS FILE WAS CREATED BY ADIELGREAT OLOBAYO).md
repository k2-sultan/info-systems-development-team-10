## Test Plan

### Test case 1: testing to see if the user can sign in or search any other data type in Bristol Open Data in Map.html

#### Results:
  Once the user tries to use the search function to access any other database, the user will be given the option to select other databases if the searched database is found.

#### Issue:
  Both my Partner and I wish to run it locally on the software by using the ArcGIS (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><pkinfo><ID>a26113cd0bef4ef0816242a08ae0b1a6</ID><size>-1</size><created>1682427367000</created><type>Web Map</type><packagelocation>https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/content/items/a26113cd0bef4ef0816242a08ae0b1a6/data</packagelocation><pkinfolocation>https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/content/items/a26113cd0bef4ef0816242a08ae0b1a6/item.pkinfo</pkinfolocation></pkinfo>) so that users will have less distractions while inspecting the map. However, we encountered an issue when we could not insert a search button ourselves i.e user could only interact with the map but could not search for specific informaion.
