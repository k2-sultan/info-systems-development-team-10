# Testing (EVERYTHING done by Raiyan Sultan)

## Test Plan
Test case 2: testing to see if the user can get any other air quality data, like CO2, in Bristol Open Data in Map.html

After clicking on an area, the air quality levels table comes up.

If we check the table thoroughly, we see only NO2 data; hence, the users will have to proceed with that data only.

#### Results:
  If the user tries to check for any other air quality data like CO2, CO, O3, in the air quality table, the user will not be able to find them, since the Bristol Open Data only has NO2 data.


#### Issue:
  Both me and my partnet wish to integrate other harmful gas data, data for gases like CO2, O3, CO, etc, so that users can check for any harmful gas levels in the areas desired while inspecting the map. However, we encountered an issue when trying to add this. While the map itself functions properly, we are unable to integrate other air quality data as intended. Ideally, users should be able to view pollutant concentrations at specific locations and other air quality data.

#### Current Status: Fail
